# Chpt 1 Problem 1
# Two bases in a DNA molecule are measured. The value of each base can be one of A, C, T or G. Assume the values of the two bases are independent. Compute answers to the following using R:

# a) 
# the sample space is the set of all possible outcomes:
# Each base has 4 possible outcomes. Since the two bases are independent, the total result will be calculated by multiplication principal:
sample.space.size = 4*4
sample.space.size
# samplesize = 16


# b)
# samplespace = {AA,AC,AT,AG,CA,CC,CT,CG,TA,TC,TT,TG,GA,GC,GT,GG}
bases <- c("A", "C", "T", "G")

# before computing, I thought case b will be larger: firstly, no card is discarded; secondly, a four-player game would be harder than a three-player game, partially means that the possible outcomes of card-combinations willd be more flexible and complexed intuitively.

# Chpt 2 Problem 1
# Random variables are functions from â„¦ to the realnumbers
# A discrete RV is a random variable that can take on only a finite or at most a countably infinite number of values, its sample space can be listed: samplespace = {a,b,c,d,...}
# A continuous RV is a range, that you cannot list the elements in the sample space one by one...
```

```{r Problem 3}
# Problem 3
# The number is observed from an experiment, so no matter it is a fixed measurement such as the length of an object, it is a RV sampling from the experiment
